# E-COMMERCE CUSTOMER SEGMENTATION (RFM ANALYSIS)

### PROJECT OVERVIEW:

The goal of this project was to analyze transactional data and segment the customer base to optimize marketing strategies. By identifying high-value "Champions" and "At-Risk" buyers, businesses can allocate resources more efficiently and drive higher retention.

### TOOLS & TECHNOLOGIES USED:

• Python (Pandas, NumPy): Data extraction, cleaning, and feature engineering.

• Math/Statistics: Calculated RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) metrics.

• DAX: Wrote logical expressions to categorize customers into distinct business segments.

• Power BI:Designed an interactive dashboard to visualize revenue distribution and segment sizes

### KEY BUSINESS INSIGHTS:

• The "Champion" Impact: Visualized how a small percentage of top-tier customers drive a disproportionate amount of total revenue.

• At-Risk Identification: Flagged formerly active customers who are slipping away, representing a prime target for re-engagement campaigns.

• Actionable Segmentation: Grouped the entire customer base into actionable buckets (Champions, Active Loyal, At-Risk, and Lost) rather than just looking at raw sales numbers.

### REPOSITORY CONTENTS:

• ecom_proj.py: The Python script used to clean the raw data and calculate the RFM scores.

• rfm4bi (1).csv: The clean dataset exported for visualization.

• E-Commerce_cust_segmentation_RFM.pbix: The original Power BI file.
